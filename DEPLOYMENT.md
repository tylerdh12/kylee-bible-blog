## üåç Environments

The application supports three environments:

### 1. Development

- **Branch**: `feature/*`, local development
- **Purpose**: Local development and testing
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (production database)
- **URL**: http://localhost:3000
- **Auto-deploy**: No

### 2. Staging

- **Branch**: `develop`
- **Purpose**: Pre-production testing and QA
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon - staging instance)
- **URL**: https://staging-kylee-blog.vercel.app
- **Auto-deploy**: Yes (on push to `develop`)

### 3. Production

- **Branch**: `main`
- **Purpose**: Live production environment
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon - production instance)
- **URL**: https://kylee-bible-blog.vercel.app
- **Auto-deploy**: Yes (on push to `main`)

## üåø Branching Strategy

### Branch Structure

```
main (production)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ develop (staging)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/feature-name
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bugfix/bug-name
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hotfix/critical-fix
```

### Branch Naming Conventions

- **Feature branches**: `feature/short-description`
  - Example: `feature/user-authentication`
- **Bug fixes**: `bugfix/short-description`
  - Example: `bugfix/login-error`
- **Hotfixes**: `hotfix/short-description`
  - Example: `hotfix/security-patch`

### Creating a New Feature Branch

Use the automated script:

```bash
npm run branch:create feature-name "Feature description"
```

Or manually:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/feature-name
```

## üöÄ Deployment Process

### 1. Development Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `main`:

   ```bash
   npm run branch:create my-feature "Add new feature"
   ```

2. Make your changes and test locally:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Run tests:

   ```bash
   npm run test:all
   ```

4. Commit changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
   ```

5. Push to remote:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/my-feature
   ```

### 2. Staging Deployment

1. Create a Pull Request from your feature branch to `develop`
2. Wait for CI checks to pass
3. Get code review approval
4. Merge to `develop`
5. Automatic deployment to staging triggers
6. Test on staging environment
7. Monitor logs and verify functionality

### 3. Production Deployment

1. Create a Pull Request from `develop` to `main`
2. Ensure all staging tests pass
3. Get final approval from maintainers
4. Merge to `main`
5. Automatic deployment to production triggers
6. Monitor production logs
7. Verify deployment health

### Emergency Hotfix Process

For critical production issues:

1. Create hotfix branch from `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b hotfix/critical-issue
   ```

2. Fix the issue and test thoroughly

3. Create PR directly to `main` (bypass staging)

4. Get emergency approval

5. Merge and deploy

6. Backport fix to `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git merge main
   git push origin develop
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup

### Local Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd kylee-bible-blog
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your local configuration
   ```

4. Set up the database:

   ```bash
   npm run setup
   ```

5. Create an admin user:

   ```bash
   ADMIN_EMAIL="admin@example.com" ADMIN_PASSWORD="SecurePass123!" ADMIN_NAME="Admin User" npm run create-admin
   ```

6. Start development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Vercel Environment Variables

Configure these in Vercel Dashboard for each environment:

#### All Environments

- `NODE_ENV`: Set to `production` for staging and production
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `JWT_SECRET`: Strong random string (min 32 characters)
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: Strong random string
- `NEXTAUTH_URL`: Full URL of the deployment

#### Production Only

- `ADMIN_EMAIL`: Initial admin email
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Strong admin password
- `ADMIN_NAME`: Admin display name

### Environment-Specific Deployments

#### Deploy to Development

```bash
npm run deploy:dev
```

#### Deploy to Staging

```bash
npm run deploy:staging
```

#### Deploy to Production

```bash
npm run deploy:production
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Management

### Schema Migrations

The application uses Prisma for database management.

#### Development

```bash
# Push schema changes (for rapid development)
npm run migrate

# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate
```

#### Production

```bash
# Deploy migrations (safe for production)
npm run migrate:deploy
```

### Creating Admin Users

#### Local/Development

```bash
ADMIN_EMAIL="admin@local.com" ADMIN_PASSWORD="DevPass123!" ADMIN_NAME="Dev Admin" npm run create-admin
```

#### Production (via Vercel CLI)

```bash
# Pull environment variables from Vercel
vercel env pull .env.production.local

# Create admin user
ADMIN_EMAIL="admin@production.com" ADMIN_PASSWORD="StrongPass123!" ADMIN_NAME="Admin" npm run create-admin
```

### Database Seeding

To seed the database with sample data:

```bash
npm run seed
```

## üéØ Linear Integration

### Setup

1. Install Linear CLI:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @linear/cli
   ```

2. Authenticate:
   ```bash
   linear auth
   ```

### Creating Issues

#### Using the script

```bash
npm run linear:create-issue "Issue title" "Description"
```

#### Direct Linear CLI

```bash
linear issue create --title "Feature name" --description "Description"
```

### Listing Issues

```bash
npm run linear:list
```

### Workflow

1. Create a Linear issue for each task
2. Create a feature branch linked to the issue
3. Reference the issue in commit messages: `feat: implement feature (LIN-123)`
4. Update issue status as you progress
5. Close issue when PR is merged

### Best Practices

- Create issues before starting work
- Link commits to issues using issue IDs
- Update issue status regularly
- Use issue descriptions for acceptance criteria
- Close issues only after deployment verification

## üîç Monitoring and Verification

### Health Checks

- **Health endpoint**: `/api/health`
- **Database diagnostic**: `/api/database-diagnostic`
- **Status endpoint**: `/api/status`

### Vercel Deployment Verification

```bash
npm run verify-deployment
```

### Log Monitoring

View deployment logs in Vercel Dashboard:

1. Go to your project in Vercel
2. Click on "Deployments"
3. Select the deployment
4. View "Build Logs" and "Runtime Logs"

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Build Failures

**Issue**: Prisma generation fails
**Solution**:

```bash
# Clear Prisma cache
rm -rf node_modules/.prisma
npm run migrate
```

**Issue**: Out of memory during build
**Solution**: Already configured in package.json with `NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=4096'`

#### Database Connection Issues

**Issue**: Cannot connect to database
**Solution**:

1. Check DATABASE_URL is set correctly
2. Verify database is accessible from Vercel's region
3. Check database credentials and SSL settings
4. Review firewall rules (Neon should allow all by default)

#### Deployment Not Updating

**Issue**: Changes not reflecting after deployment
**Solution**:

1. Check deployment logs in Vercel
2. Verify build completed successfully
3. Clear browser cache
4. Check if correct branch was deployed
